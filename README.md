A 2v2 matchmaking system, can be toggled for random or ordered teams.

How it works:

- Keep track of the player queue for this event
- When triggered, remove 4 players from queue
- Form 2 random groups
- Teleport to a new private map
- Start a fight
- Count deaths on each team until a loss condition is triggered
- Handles win and keeps track of stats on the DB
